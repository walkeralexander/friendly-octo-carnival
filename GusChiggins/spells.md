    with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 
    1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or

**Level 1: 4/4**
Chaos Bolt (Spell Attack) || Damage || Evocation
# {{{
    Casting Time: 1 action
    Range: 120 feet
    Components: V, S
    Duration: Instantaneous
    Damage: 2d8 + 1d6

    You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. 
    Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 
    damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the 
    attack's damage type, as shown below.

    --------------------
    | d8 | Damage Type | 
    --------------------
    | 1  |    Acid     | 
    | 2  |    Cold     |
    | 3  |    Fire     |
    | 4  |    Force    | 
    | 5  |  Lightning  |
    | 6  |    Poison   |
    | 7  |    Psychic  |
    | 8  |    Thunder  |
    ---------------------

    If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy 
    leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice 
    within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new 
    target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the 
    chaotic energy to leap again.

    A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this 
    spell.

    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot 
    of 2nd level or higher, each target takes 1d6 extra damage of 
    the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.

    Range: 60 feet
    Components: V
    Duration: Instantaneous

    You magically distract the triggering creature and turn its 
    momentary uncertainty into encouragement for another creature.

    roll.

    You can then choose a different creature you can see within 
    range (you can choose yourself). The chosen creature has 
    advantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving 
    throw it makes within 1 minute. A creature can be empowered by

    on ability checks made with the chosen ability.

    If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you

    new creature.

    Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can 
    see you. For the duration, any creature has disadvantage on attack

        creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell.
    Range: 60 feet
    Components: S
    Duration: Instantaneous

    You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting 
    a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or 
    lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a 
    spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your 
    spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On 
    a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect.

    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot 
    of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if 
    its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot

Gaseous Form || Utility || Transmutation
# {{{
    Casting Time: 1 action
    Range: Touch
    Components: V, S, M (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke)
    Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

    You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything 
    it’s wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. 
    The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An 
    incorporeal creature isn’t affected.

    While in this form, the target’s only method of movement is a flying 
    speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another 
    creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has 
    advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The 
    target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere 
    cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. 
    The target can’t fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned 
    or otherwise incapacitated.

    While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can’t talk or manipulate 
    objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can’t be dropped, 
    used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can’t attack or cast spells.

Fireball (Saving Throw) || Damage || Evocation
# {{{
    Casting Time: 1 action

    Components: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)
    Duration: Instantaneous

    A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you 
    choose within range then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion 
    of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot radius must make a Dexterity 
    saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or 
    half as much damage on a successful one. The fire spreads around 
    corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being 
    worn or carried.

    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th 
    level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 
    3rd.
# }}}

**Level 4: 3/3**
Banishment || Utility || Abjuration
# {{{
    Casting Time: 1 action
    Range: 60 feet
    Components: V, S, M (an item distasteful to the target)
    Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

    You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range 
    to another place of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma 
    saving throw or be banished.

    If the target is native to the plane of existence you’re on, you 
    banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target 
    is incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell ends, at 
    which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the 
    nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

    If the target is native to a different plane of existence that the 
    one you’re on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, 
    returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has 
    passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest 
    unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target 
    doesn’t return.

    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th 
    level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot 
    level above 4th.
# }}}

Polymorph || Utility || Transmutation
# {{{
    Casting Time: 1 action
    Range: 60 feet
    Components: V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)
    Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

    This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range 
    into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom 
    saving throw to avoid the effect. A shapechanger automatically 
    succeeds on this saving throw.

    The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target 
    drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast 
    whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s 
    (or the target’s level, if it doesn’t have a challenge rating). 
    The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, 
    are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains 
    its alignment and personality.

    The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts 
    to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points 
    it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping 
    to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. 
    As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal 
    form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.

    The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature 
    of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other 
    action that requires hands or speech.

    The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, 
    use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment. This spell 
    can’t affect a target that has 0 hit points.

    Casting Time: 1 action
    Range: 150 feet
    Components: V, S, M (a drop of giant slug bile)
    Duration: Instantaneous

    You point at a place within range, and a glowing 1-foot ball of 
    emerald acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot radius. Each 
    creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a 
    failed save, a creature takes 10d4 acid damage and 5d4 acid damage 
    at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes 
    half the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th 
    level or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d4 for each slot 
    level above 4th.

# {{{
    Casting Time: 1 action

    Components: S, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)
    Duration: Instantaneous

    You flourish the weapon used in the casting and then vanish 
    to strike like the wind. Choose up to five creatures you can 
    see within range. Make a melee spell attack against each 
    target. On a hit, a target takes 6d10 force damage.

# {{{
    Casting Time: 1 action
    Range: 60 feet
    Components: V, S
    Duration: Instantaneous
    Healing: 3d8 + Cha for 6 Creatures

    A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within 
    range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered 
    on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your 
    spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or 
    constructs.

    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level 
    or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
# }}}

**Level 6: 1/1**
Disintegrate || Damage || Transmutation
# {{{
    Casting Time: 1 action
    Range: 60 feet
    Components: V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)
    Duration: Instantaneous

    A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target 
    that you can see within range. The target can be a creature, an 
    object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created 
    by wall of force.

    A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. 
    On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. The target 
    is disintegrated if this damage leaves it with 0 hit points.

    A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, 
    except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The 
    creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection 
    or a wish spell.

    This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical 
    object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger 
    object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube 
    portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.

    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th 
    level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 
    6th.
